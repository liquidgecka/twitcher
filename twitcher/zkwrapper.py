"""Wrapper for zookeeper that manages watches.

This is a simple wrapper for zookeeper that allows us to use a single watch
to handle many watchers. This should vastly reduce zookeeper overhead when
many watches on the same thing are used.

This class also allows us to unregister watches which is something that
zookeeper doesn't do normally. This is important because the lack of unregister
means that an object can not be garbage collected (by nature of its reference
in the zookeeper module) until its watch fires. To handle this we instead
use this class to receive the watches with the knowledge that it shouldn't
be created and destroyed often.
